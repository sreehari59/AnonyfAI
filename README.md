## Problem Statement

As organizations increasingly digitize their information, vast amounts of personal data appear across documents,emails, and databases. With strict privacy regulations (such as **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and **HIPAA**) in place,companies face growing pressure to protect personally identifiable information (PII) and comply with data-handling laws. Identifying PII manually in large datasets is time-consuming and error-prone, making it difficult to ensure that all sensitive data is accounted for and secured.

- **Data proliferation:** Digital transformation has led to vast repositories of unstructured data, which often include names, addresses, and other personal identifiers.  
- **Regulatory compliance:** Laws like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA require that sensitive personal data be identified, managed, and protected according to strict standards.  
- **Risk of oversight:** Human review of data is impractical at scale; missing or misidentifying personal data can lead to data breaches, legal penalties, and loss of stakeholder trust.  

This project tackles the core challenge of automating personal data identification. It provides tools to detect and highlight PII within various data sources, helping organizations stay compliant and safeguard individualsâ€™ privacy in an increasingly connected world.
